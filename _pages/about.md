I am a Senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I am triple majoring in Computer Science, Data Science and Mathematics. I'm very passionate about building trustworthy AI, and my particular research interests currently revolve around (1) Analyzing cultural and moral biases in LLMs, (2) Improving temporal reasoning abilities in LLMs. Some future directions that I am planning on working towards is using reinforcement learning (RL) to incorporate human feedback as to mitigate harmful behavior of language models. Always looking for interesting NLP-related projects to join!

A fun fact about me: I was born in India, but have spent 3+ years in Thailand, Kazakhstan, China and finally Malaysi where I completed my International Baccalaureate degree at the International School of Kuala Lumpur. I love learning new languages, and have spent time improving my Russian, Mandarin, French and Hindi!
