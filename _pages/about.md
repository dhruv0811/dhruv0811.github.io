I am a current first-year Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University in the MIIS (Masters of Intelligent Information Systems) program within the LTI (Language Technologies Institute). I'm very passionate about building trustworthy AI, and my particular research interests currently revolve around (1) Analyzing cultural and moral biases in LLMs, (2) Improving reasoning abilities in LLMs. Some future directions that I am planning on working towards is using reinforcement learning (RL) to incorporate human feedback as to mitigate harmful behavior of language models. Always looking for interesting NLP-related projects to join!

A fun fact about me: I was born in India, but have spent 3+ years in Thailand, Kazakhstan, China and Malaysia each, where I completed my International Baccalaureate degree at the International School of Kuala Lumpur. I love learning new languages, and have spent time improving my Russian, Mandarin, French and Hindi!
